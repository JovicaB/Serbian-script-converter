# Serbian script converter
Automatic-Script-Recognition-And-Converter-Cyrillic-Latin

This is a simple Python class for converting text between the Cyrillic and Latin scripts used in the Serbian language.

The SerbianScriptConverter class provides two methods for converting text between the two scripts:

    lat_cyr(): Converts Latin text to Cyrillic text
    cyr_lat(): Converts Cyrillic text to Latin text

The class also has a property method called convert_script which automatically detects the script of the input text and performs the appropriate conversion.

## Usage
To use the SerbianScriptConverter class, simply create an instance of the class with the input text as a parameter and call the convert_script property method. Feel free to use and modify it as you see fit!
